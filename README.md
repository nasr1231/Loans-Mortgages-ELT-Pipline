# Loans-Mortgages-ELT-Pipline
This repository demonstrates an ELT pipeline using PostgreSQL, Sqoop, HDFS, Hive, Spark, and Airflow. Data is imported from PostgreSQL into HDFS via Sqoop, transformed with Spark, and stored in Hive tables for analysis. Airflow orchestrates and automates the workflow, ensuring a scalable and efficient end-to-end data pipeline.
